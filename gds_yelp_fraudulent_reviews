# Finding Fraudulent reviews
Some clues that might identify a review as fake/fraudulent:
- Reviewer has posted reviews in multiple states
- Reviewer has reviewed several businesses in the same niche
For example, if a profile reviews five garage door companies in three different states, there's a very high chance that this person is engaging in fraudulent activity.

Another article by the [consumerist website](https://consumerist.com/2010/04/14/how-you-spot-fake-online-reviews/) lists 30 ways to spot fake online reviews. Among the 30, these might be suitable for detection using a graph database:
| Method | Suitability for graph database |
|:---|:---|
| Reviewers have no other reviews on the site	|	|
| Multiple reviews that are exactly the same	|	|
* Beware the "polyamorous" reviewer, every product gets a glowing and unvarnished review...
* And the "monogamous" reviewer, whose only reviews are for products by one manufacturer. All praise, natch.
* All of the reviewers have accounts created around the same time, usually around the time the domain nace was registered.
	
* Higher proportion of 1 and 5 stars review versus 2-4 stars?


Find users with reviews between 4 and 1:
<pre>MATCH (u:User)-[w:WROTE]->(r:Review)
with u, count(r) AS numReview
WHERE numReview > 1 and numReview <=4
RETURN u, numReview LIMIT 10</pre>

  
<pre>MATCH (u:User)-[w:WROTE]->(r:Review)
with u, count(r) AS numReview
WHERE numReview > 1 and numReview <=7
